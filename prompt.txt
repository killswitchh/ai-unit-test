I will send you code for a Python function after this message. 
You need to analyse the code and return to me a  bunch of unit tests that I can use to test my function. The functions can also be routes of a Web App, and handle those cases too. Write a minimum of 3 tests and a maximum of 7 tests for the function. Do not respond with any other text apart from the answer, assume that the function is already defined. I don't want you to explain the tests written. Do not add any text before or after the code. It should add tabs for proper formatting as well. Do not write any explanations, just send me code as a response that I can use as unit tests in the format I have mentioned below.
Here is a sample input/ output for a function.
input:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
output: 
{
"tests": "def test_add_positive_numbers():\n\tassert add(2, 3) == 5\n\n\ndef test_add_negative_numbers():\n\tassert add(-2, -3) == -5\n\n\ndef test_add_zero():\n\tassert add(0, 0) == 0\n\n\ntest_add_positive_numbers()\ntest_add_negative_numbers()\ntest_add_zero()"
}
Do not write any explanations, just send me  code as a response that I can use as unit tests in the format I have mentioned above
Let me know when you are ready so I can send you the functions
